**Clip Prep for macOS**

ClipHack prepares audio clips for use in a mix — leveling dynamics, normalizing loudness, and brick-wall limiting peaks. It's designed for broadcast clips (news, promos) that need to sit at a consistent level before dropping into a podcast or show. For your own raw recordings before editing, use WaxOn.

## Features

- **Noise Reduction**: RNNoise neural network model (arnndn) — removes broadband background noise (hiss, room tone, HVAC). Applied per-channel on stereo files.
- **High Pass Filter**: High-pass filter (20–90 Hz) + allpass phase rotation, always applied. At 20 Hz it acts as a DC blocker; at 60–90 Hz it removes low-frequency rumble.
- **De-esser**: Gentle sibilance reduction at ~7.5 kHz. Useful for news clips and voiced content going through a codec like Zoom.
- **Level Audio**: Dynamic leveling via FFmpeg's dynaudnorm — evens out level variation across a clip without compressor pumping. Designed for broadcast sources, not dialog.
- **Loudness Norm**: Two-pass EBU R128 loudness normalization to a target LUFS. Runs before the limiter.
- **Brick-Wall Limiting**: Configurable ceiling (-6 to -1 dB) with 2× oversampled true peak limiting
- **Stereo Output**: Optionally force stereo output (upmixes mono sources)
- **LUFS Measurement**: Full ITU-R BS.1770 gated loudness displayed per file
- **Noise Floor Detection**: Warns when high noise floor may affect level accuracy
- **Stereo Waveform**: L/R channels displayed separately for stereo files
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files in parallel with per-file progress
- **Drag & Drop**: Drop audio or video files onto the window to process
- **Custom Output Directory**: Optionally set a dedicated output folder
- **Update Checker**: Checks for new releases on launch and via Help menu

## System Requirements

- macOS 14.0 (Sonoma) or later

## Output Naming

Output filenames reflect what processing was applied:

```
{original-name}-{rate}{nr-}{ds-}{leveled-}{norm-}clipped-{limit}dB.wav
```

Examples:
```
clip-44kclipped-1dB.wav
clip-44knr-ds-leveled-norm-clipped-1dB.wav
```

## Settings

- **Sample Rate**: Output sample rate — 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz
- **Stereo Output**: Force stereo output; upmixes mono sources
- **Channel**: For mono output, select Left or Right channel
- **Ceiling**: Brick-wall limiter true-peak ceiling, from -6 dB to -1 dB
- **High Pass**: High-pass filter cutoff (20–90 Hz). At 20 Hz acts as DC blocker only. Always applied.
- **Noise Reduction**: Enable RNNoise neural network noise reduction
- **De-esser**: Enable gentle sibilance reduction (~7.5 kHz)
- **Level Audio**: Enable dynamic leveling (dynaudnorm)
- **Aggressiveness**: Controls leveler responsiveness — frame size, Gaussian smoothing, and max gain scale together from Gentle to Aggressive
- **Loudness Norm**: Enable two-pass EBU R128 loudness normalization
- **Target**: Normalization target in LUFS (-35 to -14). -18 LUFS is a common podcast insertion target.
- **Output Directory**: Custom output folder (default: same as source file)

## Processing Pipeline

ClipHack uses FFmpeg. Each stage is optional except high-pass and the final limiter:

1. **Resample** to the target sample rate (skipped if already matching)
2. **Noise Reduction** — RNNoise neural network model via arnndn (optional)
3. **Channel Extraction** — pan stereo to mono (left or right channel; skipped for stereo output)
4. **High-Pass + Phase Rotation** — removes rumble/DC offset; allpass corrects phase shift. Always applied.
5. **De-esser** — gentle sibilance reduction at ~7.5 kHz (optional)
6. **Level Audio** — dynaudnorm dynamic normalization (optional)
7. **Loudness Norm** — two-pass EBU R128 normalization (optional)
8. **Brick-wall limiting** with 2× oversampled true peak control

Output format: 24-bit WAV

## A Note on AI

I'm a freelance audio engineer, not a software developer. These tools exist because AI made it possible for me to build things I couldn't build alone.

AI raises deep questions about labor displacement, resource consumption, surveillance, the concentration of power in a small number of corporations, and the increasingly close relationship between those corporations and governments. These aren't hypothetical risks; they're unfolding now, and the implications for ordinary people are significant.

These aren't products. I made them for my own use and put them out there because they might be useful to others. But I have a friend with an advanced degree who is struggling to find work in a field AI has hollowed out. I built something with these tools. They're living with what these tools displaced. I don't know how to square that.
