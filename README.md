**ClipHack** is an internal utility designed to prepare third-party audio clips (news, promos, broadcast assets) for seamless integration into a mix. It focuses on normalizing loudness and enforcing peak ceilings so that disparate sources sit at a consistent level within a podcast or show.

## Core Features
* **High Pass Filter:** Configurable cutoff (20–90 Hz) paired with allpass phase rotation (always active).
* **Dynamic Leveling:** Intelligent bidirectional leveling via `dynaudnorm` to tame inconsistent speakers or wildly dynamic clips. Includes mirror padding to prevent boundary artifacts.
* **Loudness Normalization:** Two-pass EBU R128 normalization to a user-defined target (e.g., -18 LUFS).
* **Peak Control:** 2× oversampled true peak brick-wall limiting with a configurable ceiling (-6 to -1 dB).

## Technical Specifications
* **Loudness Measurement:** Full ITU-R BS.1770 gated loudness monitoring per file.
* **Signal Monitoring:** Separate L/R waveform display for stereo files and noise floor detection warnings.
* **Boundary Integrity:** Custom mirror-padding logic for Dynamic Leveling prevents gain ramps at file start/end.
* **Batch Processing:** Parallel file processing with independent progress tracking.
* **Environment:** macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma); Native Apple Silicon and Intel support.
* **Dependencies:** Bundled FFmpeg; no external installation required.

## Processing Pipeline
ClipHack executes the following signal chain in 24-bit WAV format:
1.  **Resampling** to target rate (44.1 kHz or 48 kHz).
2.  **Channel Management** (Mono extraction or forced Stereo upmixing).
3.  **High-Pass + Phase Rotation** (always applied).
4.  **Dynamic Leveling** (optional bidirectional compression).
5.  **Loudness Normalization** (optional linear gain).
6.  **True Peak Limiting** (always applied).

## Technical Origin
ClipHack is an expert-driven signal chain built on FFmpeg. I designed the DSP logic and parameters based on professional podcasting standards, and used AI assistance to implement the Swift UI and process orchestration. 

This is a personal toolset provided "as-is." It is designed for utility and precision, not as a commercial product.
